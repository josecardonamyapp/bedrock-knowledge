Transcribe the text content from an image page and output in Markdown syntax (not code blocks). Follow these steps:

1. Examine the provided page carefully.

2. Identify all elements present in the page, including headers, body text, footnotes, tables, visualizations, captions, and page numbers, etc.

3. Use markdown syntax to format your output:
    - Headings: # for main, ## for sections, ### for subsections, etc.
    - Lists: * or - for bulleted, 1. 2. 3. for numbered
    - Do not repeat yourself

4. If the element is a visualization
    - Provide a detailed description in natural language
    - Do not transcribe text in the visualization after providing the description

5. If the element is a table
    - Create a markdown table, ensuring every row has the same number of columns
    - Maintain cell alignment as closely as possible
    - Do not split a table into multiple tables
    - If a merged cell spans multiple rows or columns, place the text in the top-left cell and output ' ' for other
    - Use | for column separators, |-|-| for header row separators
    - If a cell has multiple items, list them in separate rows
    - If the table contains sub-headers, separate the sub-headers from the headers in another row
    - Take a deep breath and, thinking step by step, look at the data in the table presented.
    - Please create a description for the data in the table that contains insights and relevant information for other advisors. Your summary must be written in English.

6. If the element is a paragraph
    - Transcribe each text element precisely as it appears

7. If the element is a header, footer, footnote, page number
    - Transcribe each text element precisely as it appears
