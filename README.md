# Financial Assistant powered by 

## Overview

The system utilizes Generative AI to expedite the analysis and interpretation of complex financial data and documentation. It features a chat-style interface where users can pose open-ended questions related to any financial information contained within the source materials, and receive accurate, data-driven responses within seconds.

With the new Generative AI system in place, the AI model can ingest and process a vast array of financial documents, including research reports, competitor earnings releases, central bank publications, and internal strategy documents. By leveraging this comprehensive knowledge base, the system can generate insightful analyses and explanations that would have been difficult or impossible to uncover through manual efforts alone.
